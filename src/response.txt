Dear Hiring Manager,

I am delighted to submit my application for the Shift Lead position at McDonald's. Having closely followed your brand's exceptional commitment to providing quality food and outstanding customer service, I believe my skills, experience, and passion for delivering a memorable guest experience align perfectly with this exciting opportunity.

My previous experience as a Data Science Consultant (Internship) at ATB Financial has equipped me with excellent analytical skills in data analysis and problem-solving. During my internship, I worked on a team that developed and implemented machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions, ensuring the security and protection of clients' financial information. This experience has not only taught me the importance of attention to detail but also the significance of working collaboratively as part of a team.

Similarly, my role as an Associate Machine Learning Developer at AltaML and ATB Financial allowed me to further hone my skills in data analysis and experimentation. I worked closely with senior managers to identify areas for improvement and developed scalable solutions using machine learning models. This experience has provided me with the ability to think outside the box and solve complex problems.
